As soon as Max could be left alone under care of ogher people, her mother went back to work, trying to earn enough to keep small family afloat.

She never really had friends; all she had was her mother, loving her and trying her best to give her daughter proper life. Max was an outcast, but wasn't bad kid; seeing her mother struggle, and feeling her love in little time they spent together, she was still trying her best to learn and not cause trouble. As teenager, she discovered gloomy goth music, and adopted the style, which stuck with her till she became adult. Soon after her puberty hit, she lost her virginity to random guy she met behind the school, where she run escaping bullies. Although not glamorous, her first time showed her pleasure she never felt before. With new outlet, she was searching for hookups, having sex with strangers. In these moments, she could forget about her problems, lose herself in pleasure. Sex was her drug, both blessing and curse. Blessing, because she never reached for another vice, be it drugs, alcohol or self harm. Curse, because after pleasure washed away, guilt remained, making her feel like worthless, cheap piece of meat for others to use. She couldn't quit, addiction was too strong, and Max was afraid what will happen to her if this pleasure will go away from her life. She never stopped working, hoping better days will come, trusting her mother's work was not for nothing. She graduated highschool with grades high enough to grant her scholarship in decent college, wher she is studying now.
